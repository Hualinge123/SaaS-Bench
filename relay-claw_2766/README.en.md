## Introduction

OfficeClaw is a multi-agent collaboration platform that organizes multiple AI Agents into a real team. The core engine **JiuwenClaw** is built with Python, extending large model capabilities to everyday communication apps.

Supports various models from Huawei Cloud MaaS platform, enabling collaborative development, code review, and task management through a unified interface.

> **Most frameworks help you call Agents, OfficeClaw helps them work together.**

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+, Git

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-org/office-claw.git
cd office-claw

# 2. Install dependencies
